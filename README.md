### About Me

Hello, my name is Samuel Adafia, welcome to my slice of the internet. I'm a Youtube and Udemy trained full-stack web developer.

I love building software and have been building for the web for the past 4 years. I'm currently studying mechatronic engineering so I can be valuable in the robot uprising.
